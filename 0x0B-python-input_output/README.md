PYTHON - INPUT/OUTPUT

Cpprdinating input/output operatioms is vital in a program's construction.
The program must have a proscribed, fast and easy way to access, store,
retrieve, and output information stored either in memory. This data is stored
mostly as simple contigous bytes of data called a file. Examples of files
inclide text file, binary files, png files etc with each with its own special
way of handling and operating on.



The following scripts carry out various I/O operations on files:

0: reads a file and prints to stdout.

1: returns the no of chars written to a file.

2: returns the no of chars appended to a file.

3: returns the json serialization of an object to a string.

4: returns the json deserializtion of a string to an object.

5: write an object to a text file using json.

6: creates an object from a file with json serialized objects.

7: adds  all objects to a list and saves to a file.

8: returns the dictionary description of simple data structure e.g lists, dict
etc

9: a class Student with input/output methods.

10: a class Student with more input/output methods.

11: a class Student with even more input/output methods.

12: constrcts a pascal triangle.
