PYTHON - EVERYTHING IS AN OBJECT

Everything is an Object!

What does this mean?

In python, there are no different "containers" which can only accomodate
specific kind of data to be stored therein. But actuall, it does have but only
just one, objects!

From variables to functions to classes, you name it, they are all basically
objects of diffferent classes in python. They are objects of standard defined
classses e.g <class string>, <class function> etc or some user defined classes.



How does this differ from the normal way of programming we are used to?

In procedural only languages like C, we indeed do have the concept of
containerization i.e what can be put in position B cannot be put in
position C and vice versa. "Data types" as they are called in languages like
C are almost inexistent in python. In python, its not the data that has a type,
but data rather has a class, i.e an object. Data types in C are engineered to
exist as obects in python.

For clarity, imagine a simple scenario/analoogy, we have say, a block we want to
store into some "container" or box. Now blocks come in different sizes and we
want to ensure we have the right box that will fit our needs.

Now, if we have to find the different boxes due of varying sizes of our block(s)
yet still stick different labels on our boxes, these are data types in C.

But if all blocks available are really of the same size(all obects), they will
fit into the same container or box. Nevertheless we still have to put different
labels on them so as to identify and differentiate them, then we have
"everything is an object in python"!




This dir contains simple txt fikes showing and decribing commands/functions we
can use to identify this "anomaly" python has when compared to other languages:

0: command to print the type of a object

1: command to print the id of an object
